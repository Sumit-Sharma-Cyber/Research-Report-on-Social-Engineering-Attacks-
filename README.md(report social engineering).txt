# Social Engineering Attacks Research Report

## 📘 Project Overview
This repository contains a detailed research report on **social engineering attacks**, which are among the most deceptive and psychologically manipulative forms of cybersecurity threats.  
The project explores how attackers exploit human trust rather than technical vulnerabilities, focusing on well-known techniques like **phishing, pretexting, and baiting**.  

This report fulfills **Task 5** of the internship program’s research component.
